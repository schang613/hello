    <P>Epic may climb up to the couch and take a nap. Recently his thing is to sit on the couch by the window and look outside
        </P>
    <p>Epic has many toys. He plays fetch with a tennis ball. Tug of war is a game he loves to play. Grab one side of the rope toy or a blue anal-bead looking toy and he will automatically grab the other side
        </p>
        
    <p>Note: Please avoid playing on the couch. The couch is for snuggling and napping. Also, please watch out for the cello displayed in the living room.
